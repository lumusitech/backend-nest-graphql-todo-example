## Description

First section. We'll introduce the technology and start with foundational concepts. The goal is to establish a solid base for configuring and using GraphQL within a NestJS application. While we'll speed up the process in later sections, here we'll take a meticulous, step-by-step approach to understand the 'what' and 'why' behind each configuration.

Specifically, we will cover:

1. GraphQL Playground: An in-browser IDE for GraphQL.

2. Apollo Studio: A powerful platform for managing and observing your GraphQL API.

3. GraphQL GUIs: Exploring various graphical user interfaces for interacting with GraphQL endpoints.

4. Resolvers: Understanding how to fetch data from the backend.

5. Args: Passing arguments to queries.

6. Queries: Fetching data from the server.

7. NestJS Integration: Installing and configuring GraphQL dependencies in Nest.

## Project setup

## Compile and run the project

    ```sh
    # development
    pnpm run start

    # watch mode
    pnpm run start:dev

    # production mode
    pnpm run start:prod
    ```

## Run tests

    ```bash
    # unit tests
    pnpm run test

    # e2e tests
    pnpm run test:e2e

    # test coverage
    pnpm run test:cov
    ```
